### Experiment name ###

Using a Light Sensor and Analog Inputs

Completed Light Sensor

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was teaching it to other students as I have completed this expiriment before. I found that explaining how the expiriment works to another student actually taught me more about it.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as automatic lights in cars (When its dark otuside the lights will automatically turn on).

### Experiment name ###

Dimming an LED using a potentiometer

#### Photo of completed project ####

Completed Potentiometer

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the way the potentiometer can contol many parts of the microbit kit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as dimming the lights in a room.

### Experiment name ###
Using a transistor to drive a motor

#### Photo of completed project ####

Completed Transistor

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the difficulty of connecting the terminal connector (Clamping the wires.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as ceiling fans.

### Experiment name ###

Using the accelerometer to control motor speed

#### Photo of completed project ####

Completed Accelerometer

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the accelerometer could be used in various ways.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as in drones as a stabilizing device.

### Experiment name ###

Setting the tone with a piezo buzzer

#### Photo of completed project ####

![Image](buzzer.jfif)

Completed Buzzer

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was it is really easy to make sounds with the microbit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as the banana keyboard I will be making for my replicaion project.
