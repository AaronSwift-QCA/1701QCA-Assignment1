## Project outcome ##

### Project title ###
Banana Keyboard
### Project description ###

The banana keyboard (apple keyboard in this case) is a muscial and entertainment project that uses the microbits functionality to make sounds with fruit. When a person touches or tries to pick up one of the fruits connected to the microbit it will make a sound. In an effort to surprise the users, the microbit is hidden to the user. This will add to the entertinment side both for the unknowing user and other people watching.

### Reflection ###

Overall the project went smoothly and was easy to complete. The hardest part was finding aligator clips and other parts which were hindered by the COVID-19 effects on the economy and the shut down of all non essential activities. Along with that I found it hard to justify going into the workshops for fear of some how catching the virus. I found that this project gave me a greater understanding of the microbit and its processes. Something I found interesting was the incorporation of headphones into the project to output the sounds. It makes me curious about what other non microbit parts could be used in future projects.
